BEM – Beytelmouneh.com – A labor of love (night time) work-in-progress on a micro version of Amazon.com web shopping cart. https://github.com/helabed/bem

BEM stands for Beyt El Mouneh (BEM). It was a micro version of a shopping cart for a real brick and mortar store front. 

BEM has a **Store front** and separate **Administration section**.

The Store front has many products grouped in Categories and Sub-Categories, and Sub-Sub-Categories, and deeper if need be.

The Admin User can access the **Administration section** where they can Create/Update/Delete (CRUD) Products in-line, i.e without leaving the Products listing.
